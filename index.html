            <p>Hi, my name is Landyn and I am from Kansas City, Missouri. I love to watch movies and spend times with 
               my friends. For work, I do maintenance for communities in my local area. That includes picking up trash, removing graffiti, and anything else I can do to help the communities. When I'm not doing that, I like to play video games.</p>

            <p>The U.S. is a country of 50 states covering a vast amount of North America, with Alaska in the northwest and Hawaii extending the nation's presence into the Pacific Ocean. It is the land of the free where you may choose to be anything you want. It is most know for its guns, food, and politics. </p>
